          Although FitMe makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its
          Services, there are times when a Service we offer will be
          discontinued or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL"). If that is the case,
          that product or service will no longer be supported by FitMe,
          in any way, effective on the EOL date.
