# Plans for the future
----------------------

- Gain traction and get customers, build the brand

- Update to Meteor 1.3

- Refactor code to use React instead of Blaze if thats the direction Meteor 1.3
  is going to take.

- Keep the Blaze version in a maintenance mode for now until further notice
  and the future with 1.3.

- Take advantage of the new import and export functionality in Meteor 1.3.

- Decide if AutoForm is the way to go or not with React.

- If AutoForm will support React then we will use it, if not then we need to
  roll our own forms and use some sort of client side validation library for
  React... JqueryValidation by the MeteorChef or some other package.

- Once code is fully migrated to react and tested then we can begin to
  add new features and take feedback from our end users.
